# Watermark

This field contains the watermark of the media file. Some source providers have their own Watermark then the value of the property is "Source". If the media file has no watermark, the value of the property is "None".

Ident archive tries to provide all media files without a watermark. If a media file has a watermark, it is noted in this field.
